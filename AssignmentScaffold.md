Section 1: Problem Definition

  1.1 Objectives 
    
    This report seeks to develop a Call Management Centre (CMC) through the Design Thinking process in response to the issues brought up 
    by the major Travel Company.  This process utilises the designer’s sensibility to help develop a  creative and groundbreaking yet 
    technologically feasible product that the client can use to take business strategy and convert it into customer value and 
    competitive advantage within the market. This report will go through the steps of the design thinking process to ensure the brief is 
    approached systematically but without the rigidity of common software development processes. The main objectives of this report is 
    to: 

      1. Develop documentation for a creative yet technologically feasible Call 
      Management Centre product 
      
      2. Develop a clear understanding of the desires of all stakeholders involved 
      within the upgrade of the Call Management Centre
      
      3. Develop several approaches to the problem to ensure many options are 
      provided for the client
      
      4. Develop comprehensive diagrams to understand the relationships across 
      different components of the Call Management Centre
      
      5. Reflect upon the developed ideas to understand the potential for 
      competitive advantage
      
      6. Reflect upon the developed ideas to understand the impact of failure on 
      the system
      
      7. Explain Agile methodology and utilise it within the scope of this report by taking activities from Scrum

  1.2 Assumptions
  
    Several assumptions have been made about the given brief to help clarify and 
    justify the reasoning behind our creative decisions as well as about certain 
    diagrams. These assumptions are as follows: 
    
      1. Competing travel companies have a more advanced CMC than the travel company’s 
      
      2. The current CMC is causing customer dissatisfaction 
      
      3. The current CMC is causing a loss of sales 
      
      4. The current CMC is difficult and inefficient to use and as such, the travel company is losing employees 
      
      5. The travel company management expects for RMs to learn more about the product offering which is outside their specialised   
      knowledge
      
      6. The holiday packages offered by  the Travel Company are only forms of holidays that involve airlines only.
      
      7. Airline companies form partnerships with the Travel Company when promoting holiday packages. 
      
      8. Relationship Managers receive a commission based income based on the number of holiday packages they sell. 
      
      9. There is a higher staff turnover at the Travel Company.
      
      10. Developers and System Admin are two different entities and are treated as such throughout the body of this report.

Section 2: Ideation

  2.1 Reflections
  
    Several assumptions were made about the given brief and will be fleshed out through the body of this reflection. The broadest 
    assumption that was made was that the Travel Company’s current Call Management Centre (CMC) was a detriment to all aspects of the 
    business. The current CMC does not compare to other travel company CMC’s and this technological hindrance means that other companies 
    have the competitive advantage. Further, it is assumed that the current CMC is causing dissatisfaction with customers as it is too 
    hard to reach an appropriate RM and the packages are hard to understand. This dissatisfaction means that customers turn to other 
    travel companies for a better customer service experience resulting in loss of business and revenue. It is also assumed that the 
    current CMC is difficult for RMs to work with, making it too difficult to reach customers and making the job they work frustrating. 
    This goes further to assume that the travel company expects that RMs thoroughly learn and understand the product offering despite it 
    being outside their specialised knowledge. The current convoluted CMC system makes learning this information difficult and makes 
    reaching customers harder. Since RMs work on commission, this difficulty to receive customers means that employees will not want to 
    stay at the company. These all compound to result in a loss of employees within the company meaning there are less RMs to serve 
    customers. Finally, it is assumed that airline companies work with the travel company to promote 
    holiday packages and holiday deals.

  2.4 Vote
  
    Most Likely To Succeed:

      Inbound callers interested in the Travel Company’s holiday packages will be first met with an automated phone calling system in         where they will use their phone keypad to input their travel destination and holiday type. This will be used to direct the      
      outbound caller to the most appropriate RM. 

      We think this idea is the most practical and will provide the company the best opportunity to revitalise their business and 
      system.

    Most Likely To Delight

      Whilst a customer is on hold, the “hold music” is a recording of an employee discussing the featured holiday packages for the   
      month meaning the customer is getting information as they wait rather than listening to annoying hold music.

      Hold music often gets annoying for customers so we decided that this idea is the most “likely to delight” because it will replace 
      the fuzzy music with informative holiday packages instead to help inform their decisions.

    Most breakthrough: 

      Relationship Managers could be specialised in certain countries and continents so that when a customer calls, they can be   
      connected with an RM who knows extensively about that continent and has been trained by the travel company.

      This idea is the most breakthrough because it would stop RMs having to learn every single package and deal within the company.    
      This would save a lot of money on training and it would give RMs the opportunity to truly understand the area of expertise which 
      will help them provide excellent customer service.

Section 4: Competitive Advantage

  4.1 Competitive Advantage
  
  The new and improved CMC will bring many benefits to the Travel Company which will bring them competitive advantage over other companies within the market. This technologically advanced system will save both the company and customers time. By rating customers, creating a customer profile based on predefined criteria and by specially training RMs by country in their knowledge of holiday packages, the process of matching a customer with an appropriate RM becomes extremely easy. This algorithmic match will mean that the customer experiences the best possible service for their desired needs without having to be put on hold for extensive periods of time and allows employees to serve many more customers within a working day. By having to spend less time switching across RMs and putting customers on hold, the travel company will reduce call costs. By matching customers with an appropriate RM, customers will feel as though they are receiving a personalised and educated view of the available holiday packages, putting trust into the company and thus retaining and gaining more customers. Customers will prefer to stay with the travel company as a result of their customer service and matching system rather than going to another travel company. By training employees and gaining more customers, employees will feel as though they are being kept busy with their work and are serving more customers, meaning high commission thus encouraging employees to stay on with the travel company rather than moving. This profiling of customers to help match customers with an RM within the new CMC clearly will give the Travel COmpany competitive advantage over other companies within the market.

  4.2 Impact of Failure
  
  The development of this updated CMC is crucial to the success of this major Travel Company. The impact of failure within this project will have massive repercussions on the company as well as all of its employees. Should the development of the new CMC fail, the Travel Company will continue to lose customers with the confusing current system. Since it is currently difficult for customers to access RMs and as such, difficult for them to discuss holiday options, customers will turn to other companies at an increasing rate. Losing so many customers will mean that RMs interact with less companies. Since RMs work on commission, they will begin to make less money and have much less to do at work. This will result in many employees leaving the travel company to instead search for bigger and better career opportunities in other companies. By losing employees and customers, the relationships the travel company had built with the airlines will be voided as the airlines will not be receiving any customers or revenue. This would mean that the airline is forced to instead form a relationship with a company that brings them business and will end the professional relationship with the Travel Company. Should the development of the CMC fail, the Travel Company will ultimately be forced to shut down since it will lose customers, employees and important professional relationships.

Section 5: Agile Methodology

  5.1 Scrum Activities Used
  
  Agile refers to a software development methodology in which the requirements elicitation and the development of those requirements progress in iterations and in smaller cross functional teams. Scrum is a form of agile methodology which introduces certain roles, artefacts and events. The most important part of scrum is the idea of sprints which is a fixed period (usually 14-30 days) to develop an iteration of the development. Each scrum team involves a product owner who is an individual that represents the end user and prioritises features, a scrum master that facilitates and manages the development and relationship between the product owner and development team and the development team which builds an increment of the product. Each scrum team involves events such as sprint planning which involves planning the amount of the backlog which will be developed for each iteration, the sprint review session which involves the product owner and development team reviewing the build that was conducted in that sprint, the daily scrum which involves status updates from the development team daily and the sprint retrospective which involves reviewing the sprint and identifying what was done right and what was done wrong. The scrum artefacts involve the product backlog which is a list of user stories that will be needed to develop the product and the sprint backlog specifies the list of user stories which will be developed in the sprint.
The group utilised the roles of product owner and scrum master. Firstly, the group members acted as product owners through the design thinking stage of the assignment. Each of us identified our stakeholders, created empathy maps and point of view statements for our stakeholder. Through creating empathy maps, we were able to understand our stakeholders and prioritise the features that should be part of the product which would maximise the value for the end user. From the point of view statements, we were able to understand the limitations of the current product which were not providing value and created a negative outlook to the stakeholder’s perception of the product and hence gave us a clearer view on what should be developed, giving us an indication on the skills of stakeholder management and prioritisation roles that a product owner would undertake. The role of scrum master was also carried out through the use of the tools on GitHub. A typical role of a scrum master would be to manage the backlog, plan and break down the work to maximise efficiency. The group undertook this role through the use of creating Issues on Github as shown in Figure 1. Each issue created was labelled with the corresponding section of the assignment that the issue was related to and assigned to each person. Each issue in the issue backlog was assigned to each team member fairly and each group member would also comment on other issues that were not assigned to them to check for a status update as shown in Figure 2. 

Furthermore, through this issue backlog, we were able to conduct sprint planning. The group did utilise this event through coming up with issues in the issue backlog as shown in Figure 1 which identified what should be worked on for the project. Whilst the group did not meet daily due to COVID-19 restrictions, a scrum stand up was undertook each week in the tutorial sessions in where we talked about what we achieved in the issue backlog and which issues can be closed using Discord, what we will be working on next and whether there were any call-outs or problems on the work assigned. Our Discord call evidence is highlighted in Figure 3.
