Section 1: Problem Definition

  1.1 Objectives 
    
    This report seeks to develop a Call Management Centre (CMC) through the Design Thinking process in response to the issues brought up 
    by the major Travel Company.  This process utilises the designer’s sensibility to help develop a  creative and groundbreaking yet 
    technologically feasible product that the client can use to take business strategy and convert it into customer value and 
    competitive advantage within the market. This report will go through the steps of the design thinking process to ensure the brief is 
    approached systematically but without the rigidity of common software development processes. The main objectives of this report is 
    to: 

      1. Develop documentation for a creative yet technologically feasible Call 
      Management Centre product 
      
      2. Develop a clear understanding of the desires of all stakeholders involved 
      within the upgrade of the Call Management Centre
      
      3. Develop several approaches to the problem to ensure many options are 
      provided for the client
      
      4. Develop comprehensive diagrams to understand the relationships across 
      different components of the Call Management Centre
      
      5. Reflect upon the developed ideas to understand the potential for 
      competitive advantage
      
      6. Reflect upon the developed ideas to understand the impact of failure on 
      the system
      
      7. Explain Agile methodology and utilise it within the scope of this report by taking activities from Scrum

  1.2 Assumptions
  
    Several assumptions have been made about the given brief to help clarify and 
    justify the reasoning behind our creative decisions as well as about certain 
    diagrams. These assumptions are as follows: 
    
      1. Competing travel companies have a more advanced CMC than the travel company’s 
      
      2. The current CMC is causing customer dissatisfaction 
      
      3. The current CMC is causing a loss of sales 
      
      4. The current CMC is difficult and inefficient to use and as such, the travel company is losing employees 
      
      5. The travel company management expects for RMs to learn more about the product offering which is outside their specialised   
      knowledge
