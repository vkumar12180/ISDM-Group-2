Section 1: Problem Definition

  1.1 Objectives 
    
    This report seeks to develop a Call Management Centre (CMC) through the Design Thinking process in response to the issues brought up 
    by the major Travel Company.  This process utilises the designer’s sensibility to help develop a  creative and groundbreaking yet 
    technologically feasible product that the client can use to take business strategy and convert it into customer value and 
    competitive advantage within the market. This report will go through the steps of the design thinking process to ensure the brief is 
    approached systematically but without the rigidity of common software development processes. The main objectives of this report is 
    to: 

      1. Develop documentation for a creative yet technologically feasible Call 
      Management Centre product 
      
      2. Develop a clear understanding of the desires of all stakeholders involved 
      within the upgrade of the Call Management Centre
      
      3. Develop several approaches to the problem to ensure many options are 
      provided for the client
      
      4. Develop comprehensive diagrams to understand the relationships across 
      different components of the Call Management Centre
      
      5. Reflect upon the developed ideas to understand the potential for 
      competitive advantage
      
      6. Reflect upon the developed ideas to understand the impact of failure on 
      the system
      
      7. Explain Agile methodology and utilise it within the scope of this report by taking activities from Scrum

  1.2 Assumptions
  
    Several assumptions have been made about the given brief to help clarify and 
    justify the reasoning behind our creative decisions as well as about certain 
    diagrams. These assumptions are as follows: 
    
      1. Competing travel companies have a more advanced CMC than the travel company’s 
      
      2. The current CMC is causing customer dissatisfaction 
      
      3. The current CMC is causing a loss of sales 
      
      4. The current CMC is difficult and inefficient to use and as such, the travel company is losing employees 
      
      5. The travel company management expects for RMs to learn more about the product offering which is outside their specialised   
      knowledge
      
      6. Airports and the Travel Company form an alliance on the holiday packages offered to maximise customer service
      
      7. Cruise companies form partnerships with the Travel Company when promoting holiday packages. 
      
      8.Aviation companies form partnerships with the Travel Company when promoting holiday packages. 
      
      9. Relationship Managers receive a commission based income based on the number of holiday packages they sell. 
      
      10. There is a higher staff turnover at the Travel Company.

Section 2: Ideation

  2.1 Reflections
  Notes: 200-300 word reflection for each POV statement/empathy map?

  2.2 How Might We Statements
    
    RMs 
      
      We met .. the Relationship Managers employed at the Travel Company
      
      We were surprised to notice .. the dissatisfaction felt from the Relationship Managers due to angry customers, low    sales, low commission and high expectations from management.
 
      We wonder if this means…the current CMC system is causing this dissatisfaction. 

      It would be gamechanging to..improve the CMC system of the Travel Company to ensure that RMs are able to make sales to happy customers and feel satisfied. 

        How might we be able improve the CMC so that RMs are able to fully utilise their expertise to create sales. 

    Airports
      We met .. the management from several airports that have an alliance with the Travel Company

      We were surprised to notice .. the low sales from the Travel Company meant that airport staff were not fully utilised and physical space at the airports that was dedicated for queues and promoting banners from the Travel Company’s holiday packages were being wasted. 
  
      We wonder if this means…that the airport will reconsider their alliances with the Travel Companies if the travel company’s sales are consistently low. 

      It would be game changing to..improve the CMC system of the Travel Company to ensure that sales are high. 

        How might we be able to improve the reputation and increase the sales for the travel company.
