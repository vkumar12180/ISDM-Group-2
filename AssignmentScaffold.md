Section 1: Problem Definition

  1.1 Objectives 
    
    This report seeks to develop a Call Management Centre (CMC) through the Design 
    Thinking process in response to the issues brought up by the major Travel 
    Company.  This process utilises the designer’s sensibility to help develop a 
    creative and groundbreaking yet technologically feasible product that the 
    client can use to take business strategy and convert it into customer value 
    and competitive advantage within the market. This report will go through the 
    steps of the design thinking process to ensure the brief is approached 
    systematically but without the rigidity of common software development 
    processes. The main objectives of this report is to: 

      1. Develop documentation for a creative yet technologically feasible Call 
      Management Centre product 
      
      2. Develop a clear understanding of the desires of all stakeholders involved 
      within the upgrade of the Call Management Centre
      
      3. Develop several approaches to the problem to ensure many options are 
      provided for the client
      
      4. Develop comprehensive diagrams to understand the relationships across 
      different components of the Call Management Centre
      
      5. Reflect upon the developed ideas to understand the potential for 
      competitive advantage
      
      6. Reflect upon the developed ideas to understand the impact of failure on 
      the system
      
      7. Explain Agile methodology and utilise it within the scope of this report       by taking activities from Scrum

  1.2 Assumptions

    justify the reasoning behind our creative decisions as well as about certain 
    diagrams. These assumptions are as follows:
