Section 1: Problem Definition

  1.1 Objectives 
    
    This report seeks to develop a Call Management Centre (CMC) through the Design Thinking process in response to the issues brought up 
    by the major Travel Company.  This process utilises the designer’s sensibility to help develop a  creative and groundbreaking yet 
    technologically feasible product that the client can use to take business strategy and convert it into customer value and 
    competitive advantage within the market. This report will go through the steps of the design thinking process to ensure the brief is 
    approached systematically but without the rigidity of common software development processes. The main objectives of this report is 
    to: 

      1. Develop documentation for a creative yet technologically feasible Call 
      Management Centre product 
      
      2. Develop a clear understanding of the desires of all stakeholders involved 
      within the upgrade of the Call Management Centre
      
      3. Develop several approaches to the problem to ensure many options are 
      provided for the client
      
      4. Develop comprehensive diagrams to understand the relationships across 
      different components of the Call Management Centre
      
      5. Reflect upon the developed ideas to understand the potential for 
      competitive advantage
      
      6. Reflect upon the developed ideas to understand the impact of failure on 
      the system
      
      7. Explain Agile methodology and utilise it within the scope of this report by taking activities from Scrum

  1.2 Assumptions
  
    Several assumptions have been made about the given brief to help clarify and 
    justify the reasoning behind our creative decisions as well as about certain 
    diagrams. These assumptions are as follows: 
    
      1. Competing travel companies have a more advanced CMC than the travel company’s 
      
      2. The current CMC is causing customer dissatisfaction 
      
      3. The current CMC is causing a loss of sales 
      
      4. The current CMC is difficult and inefficient to use and as such, the travel company is losing employees 
      
      5. The travel company management expects for RMs to learn more about the product offering which is outside their specialised   
      knowledge
            
      6. Cruise companies form partnerships with the Travel Company when promoting holiday packages. 
      
      7. Aviation companies form partnerships with the Travel Company when promoting holiday packages. 
      
      8. Relationship Managers receive a commission based income based on the number of holiday packages they sell. 
      
      9. There is a higher staff turnover at the Travel Company.
      
      10. While the aviation and cruise companies are technically different, their individual relationships with the Travel Company are 
      essentially the same and as such, are treated as one in most (if not all) aspects of this report
      
      11. Developers and System Admin are two different entities and are treated as such throughout the body of this report.

Section 2: Ideation

  2.1 Reflections
  
    Several assumptions were made about the given brief and will be fleshed out through the body of this reflection. The broadest 
    assumption that was made was that the Travel Company’s current Call Management Centre (CMC) was a detriment to all aspects of the 
    business. The current CMC does not compare to other travel company CMC’s and this technological hindrance means that other companies 
    have the competitive advantage. Further, it is assumed that the current CMC is causing dissatisfaction with customers as it is too 
    hard to reach an appropriate RM and the packages are hard to understand. This dissatisfaction means that customers turn to other 
    travel companies for a better customer service experience resulting in loss of business and revenue. It is also assumed that the 
    current CMC is difficult for RMs to work with, making it too difficult to reach customers and making the job they work frustrating. 
    This goes further to assume that the travel company expects that RMs thoroughly learn and understand the product offering despite it 
    being outside their specialised knowledge. The current convoluted CMC system makes learning this information difficult and makes 
    reaching customers harder. Since RMs work on commission, this difficulty to receive customers means that employees will not want to 
    stay at the company. These all compound to result in a loss of employees within the company meaning there are less RMs to serve 
    customers. Finally, it is assumed that airports, aviation companies and cruise companies work with the travel company to promote 
    holiday packages and holiday deals.

  2.4 Vote
  
    Most Likely To Succeed:

      Inbound callers interested in the Travel Company’s holiday packages will be first met with an automated phone calling system in         where they will use their phone keypad to input their travel destination and holiday type. This will be used to direct the      
      outbound caller to the most appropriate RM. 

      We think this idea is the most practical and will provide the company the best opportunity to revitalise their business and 
      system.

    Most Likely To Delight

      Whilst a customer is on hold, the “hold music” is a recording of an employee discussing the featured holiday packages for the   
      month meaning the customer is getting information as they wait rather than listening to annoying hold music.

      Hold music often gets annoying for customers so we decided that this idea is the most “likely to delight” because it will replace 
      the fuzzy music with informative holiday packages instead to help inform their decisions.

    Most breakthrough: 

      Relationship Managers could be specialised in certain countries and continents so that when a customer calls, they can be   
      connected with an RM who knows extensively about that continent and has been trained by the travel company.

      This idea is the most breakthrough because it would stop RMs having to learn every single package and deal within the company.    
      This would save a lot of money on training and it would give RMs the opportunity to truly understand the area of expertise which 
      will help them provide excellent customer service.
