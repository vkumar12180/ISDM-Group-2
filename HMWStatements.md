# HMW Statements will be written within this file with the contibutors listed

## TRAVEL COMPANY - Sarah 

  We met...the management of the Travel Company that has asked us to develop and manage the new CMC.

  We were surprised to notice...that the company was beginning to decline since there weren’t enough customers doing business with them, meaning the employees had no work and were leaving. 

  We wonder if this means…if the Travel Company will go bankrupt if the CMC system is not fixed

  It would be game changing to...drastically improve the CMC so that the company can lift itself off the ground again.

    How might we develop a high quality, technologically advanced CMC in a short timeline to ensure that more customers and employees do not leave the company, thus revitalising the business? 
  

## DEVELOPERS - Sarah

  We met...the developers put in charge of creating and updating the current CMC.

  We were surprised to notice...that they were feeling nervous and pressured since a lot of the company’s success is being put onto the CMC and the success of its development. 

  We wonder if this means…if the developers may feel too anxious to perform to the best of their ability.

  It would be game changing to..encourage the developers to feel relaxed by giving them a fair timeline as well as a many meetings to ensure they are able to talk about issues they are experiencing and progress that have had.

    How might we ensure the developers are performing to the best of their ability whilst embodying all the desired features of the travel company? 

## AIRPORTS - Vishaal 
  
  We met .. the management from several airports that have an alliance with the Travel Company

  We were surprised to notice .. the low sales from the Travel Company meant that airport staff were not fully utilised and physical space at the airports that was dedicated for queues and promoting banners from the Travel Company’s holiday packages were being wasted. 

  We wonder if this means…that the airport will reconsider their alliances with the Travel Companies if the travel company’s sales are consistently low. 

  It would be game changing to..improve the CMC system of the Travel Company to ensure that sales are high. 

    How might we be able to improve the reputation and increase the sales for the travel company. 

## RMs - Vishaal

   We met .. the Relationship Managers employed at the Travel Company
    
   We were surprised to notice .. the dissatisfaction felt from the Relationship Managers due to angry customers, low sales, low commission and high expectations from management.
 
   We wonder if this means…the current CMC system is causing this dissatisfaction. 

   It would be gamechanging to..improve the CMC system of the Travel Company to ensure that RMs are able to make sales to happy customers and feel satisfied. 

    How might we be able improve the CMC so that RMs are able to fully utilise their expertise to create sales.
