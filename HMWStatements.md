AIRPORTS - Vishaal 
  
  We met .. the management from several airports that have an alliance with the Travel Company

  We were surprised to notice .. the low sales from the Travel Company meant that airport staff were not fully utilised and physical space at the airports that was dedicated for queues and promoting banners from the Travel Company’s holiday packages were being wasted. 

  We wonder if this means…that the airport will reconsider their alliances with the Travel Companies if the travel company’s sales are consistently low. 

  It would be game changing to..improve the CMC system of the Travel Company to ensure that sales are high. 

    How might we be able to improve the reputation and increase the sales for the travel company. 

RMs - Vishaal

   We met .. the Relationship Managers employed at the Travel Company
    
   We were surprised to notice .. the dissatisfaction felt from the Relationship Managers due to angry customers, low sales, low commission and high expectations from management.
 
   We wonder if this means…the current CMC system is causing this dissatisfaction. 

   It would be gamechanging to..improve the CMC system of the Travel Company to ensure that RMs are able to make sales to happy customers and feel satisfied. 

    How might we be able improve the CMC so that RMs are able to fully utilise their expertise to create sales.
