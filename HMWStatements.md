# HMW Statements will be written within this file with the contibutors listed

## TRAVEL COMPANY - Sarah 

  We met...the management of the Travel Company that has asked us to develop and manage the new CMC.

  We were surprised to notice...that the company was beginning to decline since there weren’t enough customers doing business with them, meaning the employees had no work and were leaving. 

  We wonder if this means…if the Travel Company will go bankrupt if the CMC system is not fixed

  It would be game changing to...drastically improve the CMC so that the company can lift itself off the ground again.

    How might we develop a high quality, technologically advanced CMC in a short timeline to ensure that more customers and employees do not leave the company, thus revitalising the business? 
  

## DEVELOPERS - Sarah

  We met...the developers put in charge of creating and updating the current CMC.

  We were surprised to notice...that they were feeling nervous and pressured since a lot of the company’s success is being put onto the CMC and the success of its development. 

  We wonder if this means…if the developers may feel too anxious to perform to the best of their ability.

  It would be game changing to..encourage the developers to feel relaxed by giving them a fair timeline as well as a many meetings to ensure they are able to talk about issues they are experiencing and progress that have had.

    How might we ensure the developers are performing to the best of their ability whilst embodying all the desired features of the travel company? 


## RMs - Vishaal

   We met .. the Relationship Managers employed at the Travel Company
    
   We were surprised to notice .. the dissatisfaction felt from the Relationship Managers due to angry customers, low sales, low commission and high expectations from management.
 
   We wonder if this means…the current CMC system is causing this dissatisfaction. 

   It would be gamechanging to..improve the CMC system of the Travel Company to ensure that RMs are able to make sales to happy customers and feel satisfied. 

    How might we be able improve the CMC so that RMs are able to fully utilise their expertise to create sales. 

## CUSTOMERS - Christopher

**We met** with some of the potential and existing customers of the Travel Company that were contacted by phone.
   
**We were surprised to notice** that many felt that their personal needs were not being understood.
   
**We wonder if this means** our current process of personalising our recommendations is falling short of expectations.

**It would be gamechanging to** develop an automated system where the existing data we collect can be used to generate better matched recommendations for travel and accommodation.

    How might we might data with a new and imporved CMC to deliver fast, accurate and personalised recommendations for our customers.

## SYSTEM ADMIN - Christopher
  
**We met** with the system administrators of the Travel Company.
   
**We were surprised to notice** that many saw the current system and its toolset to be lacking in sophistication to respond to management enquiries.
   
**We wonder if this means** significant valuable time is wasted by system administrators that could be better spent maintaining the system.

**It would be gamechanging to** develop a new toolset alongside an improved system where these complex queries can be performed with ease.

    How might we utilise database queries and a new intuitive UI within the CMC to build a powerful toolkit for system administrations.

## AVIATION COMPANIES & CRUISE COMPANIES - name


  We met .. the representatives from aviation and cruise companies that have a partnership with the Travel Company. 

  We were surprised to notice .. the low sales from the Travel Company meant that that Aviation and Cruise Companies were not maximising their profits.
 
  We wonder if this means…that the aviation and cruise companies will reconsider their alliances with the Travel Companies if the travel company’s sales are consistently low. 

  It would be game changing to..improve the CMC system of the Travel Company to ensure that sales are high. 

    How might we be able to improve the reputation and increase the sales for the travel company in order to ensure high profits for Aviation and Cruise Companies.
